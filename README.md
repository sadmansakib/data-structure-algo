# Data structure and algorithm in python

This repository contains codes for basic algorithms written in python following TDD pattern.

**Doesn't require any extra libraries**

***Currently supported python: 3.8, 3.9***

# Contribution

- Create a new folder with algorithm name
- Create two python folder: `algorithm_name.py` and `test_algorithm_name.py`
- `test_algorithm_name.py` will contain unit tests for the algorithm
- Create a new branch and send a PR. Github actions will automatically run unit tests for your code
